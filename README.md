# Nike-Landing-Page-w-React.Js-and-Tailwindcss

This is a simple web page made with React.JS, Vite, Font Awesome and Tailwindcss as a practice on Tailwindcss. Thanks to the guys at JavaScript Mastery on their video, it was really helpful in a simple and to-the-point kind of way. I appreciate your efforts guys, you made coding seem fun ðŸ˜Š
